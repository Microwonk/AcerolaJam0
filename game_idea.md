Aberration Themed

Aberration as Visual Effects: 
Chromatic Aberration
Spherical Aberration
Astigmatism, Distortion, Field Curvature

Aberration as Disorder:
ARG
Wandering, Deviation from truth or moral, natural state
departure from what is typical

IDEA:
You can see the world around you with a distorted lens to see things you are not supposed to (with Aberration as visual effects) (horror)
things/people that stand out in an environment, which you have to find.
You are the observer (celestial), they (lucifer) managed to deceive your all-seeing eyes. god, a celestial has been overpowered. If you don't take action, what even is a god anymore? But you have to be careful, your Actions have consequences. Because those that are innocent which you kill, are to make it harder for you to find your foes.

ACTUAL IDEA:
2d Platformer. Light is your saviour, but also your enemy. You are only seen and attacked by creatures if your light is on (different light items?) [you can very slightly see, maybe through visual aberrations around you. creatures also send out waves of it], It is in a run down facility, that hosts these creatures. [ends with you escaping the facility, only to find out that you are the only one (one of the only ones) that isn't a Celestial Aberration (humans turned into it)]. You do not have anything to defend yourself, except for puzzles that can kill celestial aberrations.
