## Description

**[Celestial Aberration](https://microwonk.itch.io/acerolajam0)** is a short horror game made for the [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0) with easter eggs, (un)holy creatures and much more to explore! \
The story - though concise - is a very deep and thought out alternate reality, where in 2012, on december 12th the _Celestial Aberration_ occurs, replacing most people on earth with a "better counterpart". These creatures - called _Celestial Aberrants_ - are the "perfect lifeform" according to **most** that remain. Your role in the game is to be 'just another cog in the machine' to sustains them. You (in)voluntarily take part in a ritual called _Sacrificium_, where you are put into a simulation of when the Celestial Aberration happened. The simulation of course being pitted against you, there **should** not be a way to survive this game. After succumbing to a Celestial Aberrant in the game, you will be thrown out for them to feed on you.
