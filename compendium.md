### Wall murals

The murals on the walls have been left behind by those that have succumbed to the ritual before, being in the same fate as you. Though this time it's different. It feels as though so many have left something that the game's code has been altered in some way. This lets you not only escape and be Spared (presumably by celestial intervention), but also let you go against celestial rule and break the ritual (secret ending).

### Other

The simulation cartridge and contraption in which the ritual is being performed in has an uncertain origin. It is said the true celestial must have blessed them with it.
The where and when of your ritual is unknown, but it is seen as the turning point of humanity. The belief of many dwindles because of your accomplishments, going against celestial rule.

The ending is hidden in the pit at the end on the right-hand side.
The secret ending can be accessed through dying and pressing 1 and 2 or 3 and 6 in the menu simultaneously (see wall murals) and going to the normal ending and heading right to jump into the abyss.
